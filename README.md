# dontsteal
Python3 script to compare 2 replays and see how much they're similar to each other.

# installation

# setup
paste an osu!api key in `apikey.txt`

# usage
- you can run `python3 dontsteal.py` to compare two replays you have
- you can run  `python3 checktop50.py` to compare a replay with the top50 replays of a beatmap in osu!

# thanks to
